# Z-Wave JS Logfile Analysis

A user opened a GitHub discussion asking for help and attached a Z-Wave JS driver logfile. The logfile has been downloaded to `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/logfile.log` on this runner.

This is the discussion content (sanitized):

"${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"

Determine what the user wants to know. The discussion follows a support template, so the problem is described in prose spread over sections like "Describe the issue", "Steps to reproduce the behavior" and "Device information". Read all of them. The description of what happens and what the user expected instead is the question to answer, even when the body contains no question mark and nothing phrased as a question. When a node ID is given, the problem is about that node. Screenshots are not available to you, so rely on the surrounding text.

Only when the discussion describes no concrete symptom at all, report the most severe problems you find in the log instead.

Load the logfile with the `loadLogFile` tool, then analyze it thoroughly following your analysis instructions to answer the user's question.

Finally, post your findings as a comment on the discussion using the `add_comment` safe output. You MUST pass `item_number: ${{ github.event.discussion.number }}` explicitly — automatic targeting does not work in this workflow.
