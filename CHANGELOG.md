## 15.3.2 (2025-05-08)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a regression from v15 where command delivery verification wouldn't work on S2-capable devices without Supervision (#7795)

### Config file changes
* Disallow manual entry for param 3 on Zooz ZSE70 (#7794)

## 15.3.1 (2025-05-07)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where some CCs could be missing when Z-Wave JS was bundled (#7791)

## 15.3.0 (2025-05-05)
As of this release, Z-Wave JS no longer destroys the driver instance after NVM restore, OTW upgrades and leaving the bootloader. Previously applications had to catch the corresponding error and re-create the driver instance.

This is no longer necessary, but applications MUST ensure that they always attach the event handlers for the controller and nodes after receiving the `driver ready` event.

### Features

Z-Wave JS is now able to run in the browser! This allows for new use-cases like interactive usage examples in the documentation, and building web-based Z-Wave tools.

To celebrate this achievement, we've renamed the repository to `zwave-js`, dropping the `node-` prefix. The package names will remain the same.

### Changes under the hood

### Changes under the hood
* Further reduce dependency on Node.js internals (#7394)

## 14.3.0 (2024-11-11)
This release adds support for using the WebCrypto API as the cryptography backend. Unlike the `node:crypto` module, this API is supported by all modern browsers and JS runtimes.

Technically this is a breaking change, as `SecurityManager2` now needs to be instantiated asynchronously using `await SecurityManager2.create()` instead of `new SecurityManager2()`. However, we don't expect anyone to use this class directly, so this will not be marked as a semver-major release.

### Changes under the hood
* Improve portability of the library by supporting the WebCrypto API as cryptography backend (#7386)

## 14.2.0 (2024-11-07)
### Changes under the hood

* Add `tryUnzipFirmwareFile` utility to support zipped OTA firmware files (#7372)

### Bugfixes
* Parse negative setback state consistently (#7366)
* Ignore LR nodes when computing neighbor discovery timeout (#7367)
* Automatically fall back to `Europe` when setting region to `Default (EU)` (#7368)

### Changes under the hood
* Improve bundler-friendlyness of `@zwave-js/core` and `@zwave-js/shared` with new browser-specific entry points and `sideEffects` hints (#7374)

## 14.0.0 (2024-11-05)
In this release, a lot of the internal API was refactored to decrease interdependencies. Technically this results in a huge list of breaking changes, but most of those should not affect any application, unless very low-level APIs are frequently used. For example, Z-Wave JS UI and Z-Wave JS Server had just two small breaks. In addition, Z-Wave JS is now released as hybrid ESM/CJS packages.

### Breaking changes Â· [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating/v14)
* `Driver.installConfigUpdates()` now requires the external config directory to be configured (#7365)

* Transition modules to hybrid ESM/CJS, switch to vitest for testing (#7349)
* Removed dependency on `fs-extra` in favor of `node:fs/promises` (#7335)

## 13.5.0 (2024-10-07)
This release adds an internal task scheduler that will allow more control over longer running tasks like device interviews, route rebuilding, firmware updates, etc. These improvements include pausing/resuming tasks, better prioritization for user-initiated actions, queueing tasks without interrupting ongoing ones, and more. Migration of existing features to the new scheduler will be done incrementally, starting with route rebuilding.

### Features
